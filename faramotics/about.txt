FaRaMoTics: Fast Ranging Models for Robotics

OVERVIEW
FaRaMoTics is a software library dedicated to fast computation of range measurement models in 3D environments. 
It is specially suited for modelling range sensors, such as 2D or 3D laser scanners and time of flight cameras. 
It has been initially motivated to compute online expected range measurement data in particle filtering for real-time estimation applications, but the library can be also used to simulate these devices.

RUNNING PRINCIPLE
Technical approach and implementation details are explained in the following publication:

The main idea is to set-up a rendering minimal-sized window that fulfills sensor accuracy specfications. 
Then, in such window, render the model and read pixel depth buffer, according to each sensor ray.

MODEL LIMITATIONS
- Up to now, wide aperture devices (more than 170 degrees) are implemented only for 2D range scanners, but not for 3D scanners or depth image cameras.
